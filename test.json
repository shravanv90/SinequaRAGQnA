The net was deployed on an oblique tow from the surface to 200 m. The catch in each cod-end was preserved in 5% borax-buffered formaldehyde. The samples were subsplit in the laboratory with a Folsom splitter if needed and examined under a Leica M12. Species were examined to the lowest taxon possible - to species for copepods and euphausiids and to higher levels for other taxa.",

            "description": "This volume of the REVIZEE Documents Series presents, in atlas form, the principal groups of the zooplankton community recorded during the Program to Evaluate the Sustainable Potential of Living Resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone (REVIZEE) - SCORE Central. The specimens were collected during the Central III, Central IV and Bahia 1 campaigns, in the period from 1998 through 2000. The collections were made between the Real River in Bahia (12 degrees S) and Cape São Tomé in Rio de Janeiro (22oS), including the seamounts of the Vitória-Trindade and Martin Vaz chain. \n\nThe strategy for the plankton study, established by the National Project Proposal, had as its objective to characterize the pelagic environment, in order to evaluate the fishery potential of the continental shelf and slope of the Brazilian EEZ. This atlas is a product of this Program, and focuses on the diagnosis of the taxa identified in these samples.\n\nAtlases to aid in the identification of zooplanktonic organisms have been developed for several oceans. The two atlases previously produced for the Southwest Atlantic constitute fundamental contributions to knowledge of the marine zooplankton. However, in Brazil no atlas has yet been composed for the identification of these organisms.\n\nSix zoological groups were studied: Subclass Copepoda (70 species), Order Decapoda (30 taxa), Phylum Chaetognatha (17 species), Class Appendicularia (15 species), Order Salpida (8 species) and Order Doliolida (4 species). Several of these taxa are cited for the first time for the Brazilian coast, and the distributions of others have been extended to the southeast coast. This atlas contains general information about the zooplankton, the study area, and the collection methods. The results are presented in the form of an identification plate for each species, containing the diagnosis, ecology, and distribution, the material studied, and the literature sources used for its identification. \n\nIn this context, this atlas aims to contribute to the identification of the zooplankton of Brazilian coastal waters and to knowledge of the marine pelagic biodiversity. It is intended to continue the present work, completing it with other zoological groups not treated in this study.",

            "description": "Oceanographic surveys were conducted in the lower Bay of Fundy and Roseway Basin during the summers of 1999, 2000 and 2001. Zooplankton sampling was conducted in all years from NOAA Ship ‘Delaware II’ and additional sampling was conducted from NOAA Ship ‘Albatross IV’ in 2001. Zooplankton samples were obtained both in the presence (within a few hundred meters) and absence of right whales.\n\nDepth integrated samples were collected with a 61 cm diameter bongo frame equipped with 333 μm mesh nets and 2 General Oceanics digital flowmeters. A CTD was affixed to the tow wire ~1 m above the bongo to telemeter the depth of the nets to the ship. The bongo was lowered at 0.50ms–1 to within 5–10 m of the bottom and then hauled in at 0.33 m s–1. The ship steamed at 0.8–1.0 m s–1 (1.5–2.0 knots) during tows. A flowmeter was mounted in the centre of each bongo to estimate the volume filtered by the nets.\n\nIn the lower Bay of Fundy during 2001, depth-stratified, 1 m2 multiple opening/closing net and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS)  tows were conducted during 2001 in lieu of bongo tows. The MOCNESS was equipped with six, 150 μm mesh nets and the first of these remained open during the entire downcast to within 10 m of the bottom. The remaining five nets were towed through contiguous depth strata from the bottom of the downcast to the surface. The MOCNESS was towed at 0.5–1.0 m s–1 (1.0–2.0 knots) and paid out and hauled in at 0.33 m s–1. The volume filtered by the nets was estimated from a flowmeter positioned outside the net mouth. \n\nZooplankton samples were preserved in a 5% borate-buffered formalin and seawater solution and were subsampled in the laboratory with a Hensen stempel pipette. Subsample volumes were obtained such that 100 or more of the most abundant copepod species were counted. Calanus finmarchicus copepodite stages C3 and higher were counted separately while all other taxa were identified to species or genus level.",

The surveys are conducted 6-7 times per year over the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, using NOAA research ships or charter vessels. The Cape Hatteras to Cape Sable area is divided into four regions, and 30 randomly selected stations are targeted for sampling from each region. Along with the data collected from each cruise,  this archival package also contains the GIS shapefiles that comprise the strata used to randomly select plankton stations in the EcoMon study area.  These strata comprise 4 regions: Mid-Atlantic Bight, Southern New England, Georges Bank, and Gulf of Maine and will help the user better understand the sampling methodology.\n\nThe EcoMon investigation monitors the fishery-relevant components of the Northeast Shelf ecosystem, to characterize the baseline conditions and to determine the effects of biological and physical processes on the recruitment of Northeast shelf fishes.
